# Product Vision: RizzCapture
**Mission:** To serve as a static reference model for the 'Jefferson Cloud Marketing Methodology'—a standardized approach to AI Resilience Architecture marketing.
**Core Metaphor:** 'Trotlines, Nets, and Lures at Different Depths' (Fishing).
**Goal:** A factual, de-identified reference site that justifies business expenses (networking, travel, R&D) by mapping them to standardized marketing frameworks.

## The Methodology (The Fishing Metaphor)
1. **Trotlines (The Long Game):** Automated, low-level scanning tools (e.g., LinguaLint) that run in the background to catch opportunities.
2. **Nets (The Forecast):** Predictive analytics (e.g., Water Audits, Housing Permits) that catch market shifts before they arrive.
3. **Lures (Social Depth):** The 'Socialize, Decode, Consult' funnel.
   - *Surface Depth:* Merchandise (books/cards).
   - *Mid-Depth:* Singing/Poetry at events (filling space).
   - *Deep Depth:* Dinner/Consulting (The Sands Club).

## Key Concepts
- **Guerrilla Marketing:** Omnipresence via standardized networking (Church, Sports, Clubs).
- **Tactical Shorthand:** The protocol for rapid consultation handoffs.
- **Symbolic Capital:** Quantifying reputation using Bourdieu's 'Distinction'.
